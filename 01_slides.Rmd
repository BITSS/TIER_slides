An under discussed benefit of this principle is that increases access to knowledge for students who are outside of elite schools (no connections or "appropriate politeness" required to obtain materials).

.font120[
- In each of the previous steps there was valuable new knowledge 
- This knowledge is not usually disseminated  
  - End of semester report, or presentation that is not published. 
  - Language across courses is not standard (reproduction? replication?)
  - Current attempts to record this are closer to a full paper format (see [Replication Wiki](https://replication.uni-goettingen.de/))
- As a result there is a large amount of missed knowledge.  
   - Each new semester, new students repeat similar excesses and have to reinvent the wheel.  
   - Lost opportunity for building on top of previous exercises. 
   - Lost opportunity for aggregating the new knowledge.

# .font90[**A**ccelerating **C**omputational **Re**producibility: Framework]
## Context for ACRe

- American Economics Association (AEA) creates first data policy in 2006.  

    - Must publish some data (waivers available)
--

- AEA updates [policy in 2019](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code/). 
    - Must post all data and code. Publication is conditional on verifying reproducibility (if confidential: must document extensively) 
    - A new requirement is to post all cleaning code, even for data that is not public
    - See Lars Vilhuber's presentation after this one (same zoom channel) for more information 
- Similar updates in Political Science (see [AJPS new policy](https://ajps.org/ajps-verification-policy/
))
--

- We should expect high levels of computational reproducibility after 2019 (AEA). 
--

- We should not demand 100% reproducibility before, but we could identify the gaps and try to improve some.

# .font90[**A**ccelerating **C**omputational **Re**producibility: Framework]

## Beyond Binary Judgments    

Reproductions can easily gravitate towards adversarial exchanges.
  - Early career researchers (ECR) have incentives to emphasize unsuccessful reproductions 
  - Original authors have a more senior position and can use it to deter in-depth reproductions from ECRs. 
  - The media also focuses on eye-catching headlines

--


### Our approach: 

We do not want to say 
 > "Paper X is (ir)reproducible"    
 
  
--
We do want to say 
 > "Result Y in paper X has a high/low level of reproducibility according to several reproduction attempts. Moreover, improvements have been made to the original reproduction package, increasing its reproducibility to a higher level"

# Identify All the Elements Behind a Display Item

Reproducers will be asked to draw a clear connection to the raw data sources mentioned in the paper and the display item under reproduction. 
--

### Data sources  
Connect the data sources in the paper's text with specific raw data files. 
--

### Analytic data sets  
Describe each analytic data file. 
--

### Code files  
Inspect all code files and record all their inputs and outputs. 

With all the information recorded above, reproducers can use the **ACRe Diagram Builder** to generate a **reproduction tree**.

**Reasonable specifications** ([Simonsohn et. al., 2018](https://urisohn.com/sohn_files/wp/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Paper-Specification-curve-2018-11-02.pdf)): 

 1. Sensible tests of the research question
 2. Expected to be statistically valid, and 
 3. Not redundant with other specifications in the set.

Reproducers will be able to record two types of contributions: 

- Mapping the universe of robustness checks
- Proposing a specific robustness check

>Dear Dr. `[Lastname of Corresponding Author]`,

> I am contacting you to request a reproduction package for your paper titled `[Title]` which was published in `[Reference]`. A reproduction package may contain (raw and/or analytic) data, code, and other documentation that makes it possible to reproduce paper. Would you be able to share any of these items?
>
>I am a `[position]` at `[Institution]`, and I would like to reproduce the results, tables, and other figures using the reproduction materials mentioned above. I have chosen this paper because `[add context ...]`. Unfortunately, I was not able to locate any of these materials on the journal website, Dataverse `[or other data and code repositories]`, or in your website.
>
>I will record the result of my reproduction attempt on ACRe [...]. With your permission, I will also record the materials you share with me, which would allow access for other reproducers and avoid repeated requests directed to you. Please let me know if there are any legal or ethical restrictions that apply to all or parts of the reproduction materials so that I can take that into consideration during this exercise.
>
>In addition to your response above, would you be available to respond to future (non-repetitive) inquiries from me or other reproducers conducting an ACRe excercise? Though your cooperation with my and/or any future request would be extremely helpful, please note that you are *not required to comply*.

>Since I am required to complete this project by `[date]`, I would appreciate your response by `[deadline]`.
>
>Let me know if you have any questions. Please also feel free to contact my supervisor/instructor `[Name (email)]` for further details on this exercise. Thank you in advance for your help!
